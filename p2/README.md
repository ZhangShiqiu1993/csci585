### spatial data in database

screen-shot of the project

1. I picked nine coordinates in USC campus area. ![nine_locations](https://github.com/ZhangShiqiu1993/db_management/blob/master/p2/1.nine_locations.png?raw=true)

2. Computed the convex hull of those nine coordinates.

*PostGIS calculate convex hull*
![]()

3. Found the three nearest neighbors from my living apartment.

*PostGIS calculate knn (k-nearest neighbors)*
![]()

4. Drawn a Spirograph curve around the teaching building SGM.
